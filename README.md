Live Football World Cup Scoreboard Library
This is a simple library implementation for managing a Live Football World Cup Scoreboard. It provides functionality to start matches, update scores, finish matches, and get a summary of ongoing matches.

Features

Start a new match with initial score 0 - 0
Update scores for ongoing matches
Finish a match and remove it from the scoreboard
Get a summary of matches in progress, ordered by total score and start time

Dependencies

Java 17
JUnit 5.8.2 (for testing)

Building and Testing
This project uses Maven for dependency management and building. To build and run tests, use the following command:
Copymvn clean test
Usage
Here's a simple example of how to use the ScoreboardService:
javaCopyScoreboardService service = new ScoreboardService();

// Start matches
Match match1 = service.startMatch("Mexico", "Canada");
Match match2 = service.startMatch("Spain", "Brazil");
Match match3 = service.startMatch("Germany", "France");
Match match4 = service.startMatch("Uruguay", "Italy");
Match match5 = service.startMatch("Argentina", "Australia");

// Update scores
service.updateScore(match1, 0, 5);
service.updateScore(match2, 10, 2);
service.updateScore(match3, 2, 2);
service.updateScore(match4, 6, 6);
service.updateScore(match5, 3, 1);

// Get summary
List<Match> summary = service.getSummary();
summary.forEach(System.out::println);

// Finish a match
service.finishMatch(match1);
Assumptions and Notes

The scoreboard uses an in-memory store (ArrayList) to keep track of matches. This means that data is not persistent across program executions.
Matches are uniquely identified by their object reference. In a real-world scenario, you might want to add a unique identifier to each match.
The system is not thread-safe. In a multi-threaded environment, you would need to add synchronization mechanisms.
The project follows SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility Principle: Each class has a single responsibility (Match, Scoreboard, ScoreboardService).
Open/Closed Principle: The system is open for extension (e.g., adding new scoring rules) but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle: Not directly applicable in this simple example, but the design allows for easy implementation of subtypes if needed.
Interface Segregation Principle: The interfaces are minimal and focused.
Dependency Inversion Principle: The ScoreboardService depends on the Scoreboard abstraction, not on concrete details.


Test-Driven Development (TDD) was used to implement the system, ensuring that all functionality is thoroughly tested.
Error handling is minimal in this implementation. In a production system, more robust error handling and logging would be necessary.

Future Improvements

Implement data persistence (e.g., database integration)
Add more advanced match statistics (e.g., possession, shots on target)
Implement a user interface (e.g., command-line interface or REST API)
Add authentication and authorization for updating scores
Improve error handling and input validation
Make the system thread-safe for concurrent access
Add unique identifiers for matches
